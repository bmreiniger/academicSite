Advice for WebAssign:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should first attempt each assigned problem on paper (log off the WebAssign website)
like regular paper and pen assignments. Save this written work for review before quizzes and
exams and in case you have to discuss your solution with me.
<li>Carefully read the WebAssign Student Guide to understand how to format your solutions.
<li>When you have finished entering your answers, click on "Submit" and WebAssign will immediately 
grade your solutions. You can then re-work your incorrect problems and re-submit
them to improve your score. You can submit your assignment up to 5 times without penalty.
<li>After two incorrect attempts, look at the book again, review your notes and re-do the problem
from scratch. Do not guess an answer. Remember you have only 5 attempts for each problem,
so do not waste your attempts on frivolous trial and error solutions.
<li>Do not enter an equivalent expression when your answer is marked wrong; the software behind
 Webassign matches equivalent expressions.
<li>Avoid simple mistakes like: wrong syntax, incorrect usage of parentheses, incorrect letter 
for a parameter or variable.
<li>If you have technical difficulties with the WebAssign website, please contact their technical
support directly online.

 Errata to the practice exam: 
   <ul><li>Solutions #3: Near the end, the projection should have $|n|$ in the denominator instead of $|v|$, which (together with fixing an arithmetic mistake) leads to a final answer of $\sqrt{5}$.
       <li>#3: $\ell_1$ is not the same as the one above.  Use this one.
       <li>#13d: The numerator was meant to be $x^3 y$.  (As written, the limit would be zero.)
       <li>#14: I meant to also ask about $f_y$ at the upper-central point.
       <li>#16: It makes more sense to approximate $f(1.1,0.1)$.  Anyway, the problem isn't wrong as written, you're just less likely to get a "good" approximation.

 Errata to the practice exam solutions: In #14, the lower bound on $y$ should be just $r^2$.
