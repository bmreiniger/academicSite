<h2>Talk Descriptions</h2>
<p>
<b>Trillions and trillions of digits of &pi;</b><br>
<i>Andrew Shallue, Illinois Wesleyan University</i><br>
Time: 9:26am<br>
Abstract: While 3.14 is a decent approximation of π for most purposes,
 humans throughout history have been driven to find better approximations. 
 Modern digit hunters, using new algorithms and lots of computing power,
 have succeeded in finding multiple trillions of digits of π. 
 In this talk we will cover several methods for computing digits, and
 discuss whether computing so many digits is more than just a fun parlor trick.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ramanujan and &pi;</b><br>
<i>Bruce Berndt, University of Illinois</i><br>
Time: 11:00am<br>
Abstract: We discuss some formulas and approximations to π,
 emphasizing contributions of India's great mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan.
</p>

<p>
<b>What is &pi;?</b><br>
<i>Wendy Cho, University of Illinois</i><br>
Time: 1:00pm<br>
Abstract: We’ll explore the question, “what is π?”.  We all know it from
 formulas for the area and circumference of a circle, but how did it get there and what does it mean?
</p>

<p>
<b>&pi;, primes, and Pythagoras</b><br>
<i>Kenneth Stolarsky, University of Illinois</i><br>
Time: 1:45pm<br>
Abstract: The Pythagorean theorem is at the root of much of the development of
 number theory and (much later) analytic geometry. We show how these two
 separate lines of development eventually came together to produce remarkable
 new insights into an old exact formula for π. Some of the history is quite
 curious, and much of the story can be understood even without a knowledge of
 calculus! Just bear in mind that the area of a disc is π * r<sup>2</sup>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Belts and Primes: Two Anecdotes about π</b><br>
<i>Fusun Akman, Illinois State University</i><br>
Time: 3:30pm<br>
Abstract: If the Earth were to swell magically outward one foot at each point,
 how much longer would the equator be? If this happened to you, how much longer
 would your belt need to be? (Easy) OK, suppose you pull out two random natural
 numbers from a hat. What is the probability that they are relatively prime? (Hard)<br>
I have never swelled one foot all the way around the belly, and I have never pulled
 two random numbers from a hat. But these problems have a special place in my
 academic life and philosophy. Come and find out why. We will also talk about
 infinite sums, infinite products, the Riemann zeta function, and of course, π.
 No special background is needed, and there will be no quiz.
