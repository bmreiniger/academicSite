Most of the Ebook used here was put together by Yelda Aydin-Mullen.
It is a compilation of sections from free web resources, authored by
1) Terry Wesner and Harry Nustad,
2) David Arnold and Bruce Wagner,
3) Tyler Wallace,
4) Wade Ellis and Denny Burzynski

I have added a few sections, which are simply links to Paul's Online 
Notes.  (They are distinguished by having ".lnk" file extensions [which
is not of importance; my site redirects you from those empty files
to Paul's site].)
