%\part A graph $G$ is bipartite if and only if $G\cp K_2$ is bipartite.
%\part Find (with proof) the largest number of edges in a $C_4$-free subgraph of $Q_3$.
%HOW TO PHRASE?  
%Let $G$ be a connected weighted graph with an edge $e$ of weight zero (and every other edge having positive weight).  How are the problems MinSpTree, MinDist(u,v), ChinesePostman on $G$ related to those on $G-e$, $G\cdot e$, $G+(\text{copy of $e$ with weight 0})$, $G+(\text{copy of $e$ with positive weight})$?

\question Let $G$ be an $X,Y$-bigraph with $n$ vertices.  Please note that throughout this problem we are using $\alpha(G)$, not $\alpha'(G)$.
\begin{parts}
%3.1.40, but the solution there uses alpha+beta=n
\part[6] Prove that $\alpha(G)\geq n/2$.
\vfill
\part[10] Prove that if $G$ has no perfect matching, then $\alpha(G)>n/2$.  \textit{(Suggestion: first, is $|X|=|Y|$?  Then use Hall's Theorem.)}
%If G is not balanced, then alpha>n/2; so suppose G is balanced.
%If G has no perfect matching, then there is an S\subseteq X$ with $|N(S)|<|S|$.  Now S\cup (Y-N(S)) is an independent set, and has size |S|+(n/2)-|N(S)|>n/2.
\vfill\vfill
\part[10] Prove that if $\alpha(G)>n/2$, then $G$ has no perfect matching.  \textit{(Suggestion: use Tutte's 1-Factor Theorem.)}
%Let I be an independent set of size >n/2, and consider S=V(G)-I.  Then G-S has |I| odd components (isolated vertices) and |S|<n/2<|I|=o(G-S).
\vfill\vfill
\end{parts}
%always for bipartite, \alpha \geq n/2.   if \alpha>n/2, then either not balanced hence no p.m., or there such set I intersects both X and Y.  Say |I\cap X|\geq |I\cap Y|.  Let S=I\cap X; then N(S)\subseteq Y\setminus I, so |N(S)|\leq |Y-I| = |Y|-|Y\cap I| \leq |Y|-|S|......

\newpage

\question[24] Prove \textbf{three} of the following four statements.  \textit{(All of these have short proofs, some \emph{very} short.)}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item %5.2.1
If $G$ is a graph such that $\chi(G-x-y)=\chi(G)-2$ for every pair of distinct vertices $x,y$, then $G$ is a complete graph.
%suppose to the contrary that G is not complete: there exists xy\notin E(G).  And suppose that G-x-y is (\chi(G)-2)-colorable.  Then we may use one additional color on each of x and y, for a (\chi(G)-1)-coloring of G, a contradiction.

%\question Suppose a graph has degree sequence 6,6,6,4,3,3,3,3.  Can you determine its chromatic number?  (If not, give the best bounds you can.)   
%\leq 3 by greedy; cannot be bipartite because only one degree not divisible by 3
%is graphic?  5533222, 422211, 11110, yep

\item Always $\chi(G)\cdot \chi(\overline{G})\geq n(G)$.
%\question Prove that $\chi(G\cup H) \leq \chi(G)\chi(H)$.
%pf1: \chi(G)\geq n(G)/alpha(G) = n(G)/\omega(\overline{G}) \geq n(G)/\chi(\overline{G}).
%pf2: consider optimal colorings of f of G and g of \overline{G}, and at each vertex v consider the ordered pair h(v):=(f(v), g(v)).  For each edge xy of G, f(x)\neq f(y), so h(x)\neq h(y); and for each nonedge xy of G, xy is an edge in \overline{G}, so g(x)\neq g(y), so h(x)\neq h(y).  Thus, h is an injection from V into [\chi(G)]\times[\chi(H)].

%\question %3.1.19
%....system of distinct representatives....

\item %(3.3.10) 
Always $\beta(G)\leq 2\alpha'(G)$. % For each $k\in\mathbb{N}$, construct a simple graph $G$ with $\alpha'(G)=k$ and $\beta(G)=2k$.
%Consider a maximum matching M.  Then the set of endpoints of edges in M has size 2\alpha', and is a vertex cover: if any edge is not covered, then it could be added to M, contradicting its maximality.

\item %(3.1.9)
Every maximal matching in a graph $G$ has size at least $\alpha'(G)/2$.
%pf1: Let M be maximal and M^* maximum matching.  Consider M\symmdiff M^*: each component is an even cycle or a path.  An even cycle has an equal number of M- and M^*-edges, and any path of length at least two has at most twice as many M^*-edges as M-edges.  Only a component consisting of one M^*-edge contributes more, but in this case such an edge could be added to M, contradicting its maximality.
%pf2: Let M be maximal and M^* maximum matching.  Suppose to the contrary that |M^*|>2|M|.  Then M saturates fewer than $M^*$ vertices, and hence some edge of M^* can be added to M, contradicting maximality of M.
%pf3: (similar to pf2). Let M be maximal matching; the endpoints of M form a vertex cover (if an edge is uncovered, then it could be added to M).  So 2|M|\geq \beta \geq \alpha'.

\end{enumerate}



%(The next are probably better as T/F, with just short justification)
%\question %5.1.12
%Prove or disprove: every optimal coloring of $G$ has a color class of size $\alpha(G)$.
%Prove or disprove: every $k$-chromatic graph $G$ has a proper $k$-coloring with a color class of size $\alpha(G)$.
%\question %5.1.15
%Prove or disprove: if $a$ is the average degree of $G$, then $\chi(G)\leq 1+a$.
