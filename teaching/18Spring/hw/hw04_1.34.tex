Turn in four of the following problems to be graded.

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
\item (1.3.52)  Prove that $K_{\floor{n/2},\ceil{n/2}}$ is the only sharpness example for Mantel's Theorem.  That is, show that if $G$ is a triangle-free $n$-vertex simple graph and $e(G)=\floor{n^2/4}$, then $G\cong K_{\floor{n/2},\ceil{n/2}}$.  \textit{(Hint: follow the proof of Mantel's Theorem.  Knowing $e(G)$ allows you to conclude that some inequalities must be equalities.)}

\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item (1.3.57)  Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and let $d$ be a list of $n$ nonnegative integers with even sum whose largest entry is less than $n$ and differs from the smallest entry by at most 1 (e.g., 443333 or 33333322).  Prove that $d$ is graphic.
\item Conclude that there is a $k$-regular $n$-vertex simple graph if and only if $k<n$ and $kn$ is even.  \textit{(Remark: it might not be so easy to prove this directly, especially by induction.  We  ``strengthened the induction hypothesis'' above to include more sequences, and the resulting induction was much easier.)}
\end{enumerate}

\item (1.3.63)  Let $d_1\geq d_2 \geq \dotsb \geq d_n \geq 0$.  Prove that there is a loopless graph (multiple edges allowed) with degree sequence $d_1, \dotsc, d_n$ if and only if $\sum d_i$ is even and $d_1\leq \frac12 \sum d_i$.

\medskip

\item (1.4.14) Let $D$ be an $n$-vertex digraph with no cycles.  Prove that the vertices of $D$ can be ordered as $v_1, \dotsc, v_n$ so that if $v_i\to v_j$, then $i<j$.

\item (1.4.23)   Prove that every graph $G$ has an orientation $D$ such that $\left|d^+_D(v)-d^-_D(v)\right|\leq1$. for every $v\in V(G)$.  \textit{(VagueHint\texttrademark: is $G$ Eulerian?)}

\item (1.4.26ish) Find a cyclic list of 16 bits so that the 16 strings of five consecutive bits are all the 5-bit strings with at least three 1's.  Explain your construction method.  \emph{(Hint: below is a drawing of $D_5$; use it.)}

\end{enumerate}
